# Expense-Income Tracker with JWT/Auth 
   At the WebApp you can see your current balance, you can create transactions as well you are able to edit and delete. 
   This project was built using: -ReactJS (v18.1.0) -NodeJS (v17.7.2 ) -Express(v4.18.1) -Sequelize (V6.19.0)
   
   The data base is a PostgreSql db, at the .env file you should change the variables POSTGRESDB, POSTGRESUSER,POSTGRESPASS and POSTGRESHOST so you can connect to your own db.   
   
   In the .env file, you can find all the key variables, feel free to change them. 


Once you get the up running, sign up to have your own data.
